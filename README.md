# Prior-Constrained-Backpropagation-PCB-
Prior-Constrained Backpropagation (PCB) is a calibration algorithm designed for cross-regional transfer of forest carbon stock estimation models. It addresses the common challenge where a robust model exists for a data-rich source region but performs poorly when directly applied to a target region with limited local samples
